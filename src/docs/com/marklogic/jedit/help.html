<h2>How This Works</h2>
<p>
   The Mark Logic jEdit plugin is a connector that submits
   queries to a Content Interaction Server engine and returns
   the result.  The source of the query text is a jEdit
   edit buffer of your choice and the result of the query
   is stored to another buffer you choose.
</p>
<p>
You can edit an XQuery script, run it and see the result very
quickly and easily.
</p>

<a name="layout"></a>
<h2>Laying Out jEdit</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to use this plugin is to dock it into the
main jEdit view and split the editor pane horizontally
so that you can see the file you're editing and the result
pane at the same time.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Mark Logic plugin if it's not already open.  Select the menu:
Plugins -&gt; Mark Logic -&gt; Mark Logic Console</li>
<li>The Mark Logic Console will open as a floating window.
Locate the little inverted triangle icon in the upper left
and click it to drop down the docking menu.</li>
<li>Select Dock At Right.  The floating console will close
and the console will dock into the right side of the jEdit main window</li>
<li>On the main jEdit toolbar, locate the Split Horizontally button
(two triangles separated by a horizonal line).  Click that button and
the main editor pane should split into two windows.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Above each buffer window is a drop-down to select a currently
open buffer.  A given buffer can be visible in more that one
edit window.  What you want to do now is use the top edit window
to edit your XQuery source, and use the lower one as the destination
for the output.
</p>
<p>
Focus the upper edit window and then select
File -&gt; Open to open an existing file, or File -&gt; New to start
a new, empty file.  In the Mark Logic Console, select the buffer to
use as the XQuery source from the drop-down selector.
</p>
<p>
Focus the lower edit window and select or create an empty buffer.
In the console, select that buffer as the output destination.
You may also select the New Buffer radio button to automatically
create a new buffer the next time you run a query.
Note that whichever edit window is active when you
run the query will switch to the newly created buffer.  This
is not a problem, but you may need to reselect the buffers to display
the right one in each of the split panes.
</p>
<p>
Once you've laid out the jEdit windows, the layout will be remembered
when you restart jEdit.  There is no need to save the configuration.
</p>

<h2>Configuring The Plugin</h2>
<p>
Before you can use the plugin you need to configure it
so it knows where the server is located.  In the Mark Logic Console,
click the Config tab at the top and enter either the
hostname/port of the server or a JNDI lookup key and the user/password credentials.
The information you enter will automatically be saved by jEdit
and need not be entered on each run.
</p>

<a name="running"></a>
<h2>Running a Query</h2>
<p>
Once you've selected which buffer to run the query from and where
the result should go, click the Run Query button to send the query
to the server.  There is also a menu item (Plugins -&gt; Mark Logic
-&gt; Run Query) which you can use to run a query.  The menu item is
not very useful, but it defines a shortcut key, Control-/, which
can be used to run a query.  This can very handy for quick edit/run
round-tripping.

<h2>Online Documentation</h2>
<p>
The Mark Logic <b>xq:zone</b> Developer Community site
(<a href="http://xqzone.marklogic.com">xqzone.marklogic.com</a>)
has all Content Interation Server documentation online for easy
reference.  The documentation root page is at

The code for this open source project is hosted

<p>
Hyoerlinks are not active in the console help panel.  To follow
the links, open the jEdit Help Viewer (F1) and select the help section
for Mark Logic.  Or copy/paste the URL into a web browser.  Unfortunately,
the builtin Java HTML renderer in jEdit does not display the XHTML pages
on the <b>xq:zone</b> site very accurately.
